# codexcomp

**Codex + Complete** — a lightweight local proxy that folds gpt-5.5's **"516" reasoning
truncation** into complete, untruncated answers for the [OpenAI Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex).

```bash
uv tool install codexcomp      # install
codexcomp                      # run (127.0.0.1:8787)
# then append to ~/.codex/config.toml:  openai_base_url = "http://127.0.0.1:8787/v1"
```

It overrides the built-in provider's base URL **in place** — `model_provider` is unchanged,
so session grouping, remote compaction, and remote-control keep working.

## The problem

gpt-5.5's reasoning is intermittently truncated at `reasoning_tokens == 518·n − 2`
(**516, 1034, 1552, …**): the turn stops mid-reasoning and answers from an incomplete
thought, degrading quality sharply. Aggregate telemetry in the upstream report shows ~44 %
of gpt-5.5 responses that reach 516 reasoning tokens end at exactly that boundary — an
upstream defect with no official fix
([openai/codex#30364](https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/30364)).

`codexcomp` sits on `127.0.0.1` between Codex and the upstream Responses API. On a `518n−2`
truncation it drives the model to keep reasoning and folds the extra rounds into a single
downstream response — Codex sees one complete, untruncated answer.

## Features

- **Detect → continue → fold** — spots the `518n−2` fingerprint, replays the round's
  reasoning with a continue nudge, and folds all rounds into one response.
- **Zero-footprint wiring** — one official top-level `openai_base_url` key; no
  `[model_providers]` entry, no provider id change, no session re-bucketing.
- **WebSocket-first transport** — native `responses_websockets` protocol (envelope frames,
  serial connection reuse, prewarm); no "Falling back" noise in Codex logs.
- **Resilient SSE fallback** — the POST path transparently decompresses zstd/gzip upstream
  responses.
- **Full `/v1/*` passthrough** — including `GET /v1/models` (model catalog refresh).
- **Protocol-faithful headers & compaction** — upstream response headers reach Codex on the
  POST path (`x-codex-*` rate-limit snapshots, `x-models-etag`, request ids), the
  `x-codex-turn-state` sticky-routing token is replayed across fold rounds when the upstream
  issues one, and remote-compaction requests are never folded.
- **Live streaming** — reasoning streams in real time even mid-fold; only the final clean
  round's output is released downstream.
- **Honest accounting** — the true cumulative cost of folded rounds is reported under
  `metadata.proxy_billed_usage`.
- **Self-healing upstream pool** — an exhausted or wedged connection pool (`PoolTimeout`,
  dead proxy handshakes) rotates the shared upstream client to a fresh generation instead
  of failing every request until a restart; per-client leases guarantee in-flight streams
  and folds are never interrupted, and `/healthz` reports the generation and active counts.
- **Loopback-only, auth passthrough** — forwards Codex's `Authorization` header; never
  reads, persists, or logs a credential.
- **Opt-in autostart** — installation registers nothing; one command sets up a systemd user
  unit (Linux/WSL) or LaunchAgent (macOS).

## Quick start

Requires [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and the Codex CLI (ChatGPT OAuth; tested on 0.142.x).

```bash
uv tool install codexcomp                                  # from PyPI
# uv tool install git+https://github.com/dzshzx/codexcomp  # or from source
codexcomp                                                  # foreground, 127.0.0.1:8787
```

Point Codex at the proxy with one top-level config key:

```toml
# ~/.codex/config.toml  (top level, before the first [table])
openai_base_url = "http://127.0.0.1:8787/v1"
```

That's it. Disable by removing that line and stopping the proxy; upgrade / uninstall with
`uv tool upgrade codexcomp` / `uv tool uninstall codexcomp`.

## How it works

A state machine (`codexcomp/fold.py`) runs per round:

1. **Detect** — `reasoning_tokens == 518n − 2` (any tier by default; cuts up to n=21 observed —
   see `--max-n` / `--max-continue`) marks the round as truncated.
2. **Continue** — discard the tentative output and replay the round's reasoning items (incl.
   `encrypted_content`) plus one `phase:"commentary"` `"Continue thinking..."` message as the
   next input. If a continuation round comes back with zero reasoning tokens (the nudge
   stalled), it is re-nudged rather than accepted, spending from the same `--max-continue` budget.
3. **Fold** — stream reasoning live, flush only the final clean round, and rebuild the terminal
   event as one response (reasoning summed, true cost under `metadata.proxy_billed_usage`).

## CLI reference

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `codexcomp` / `codexcomp run` | Start the proxy in the foreground. |
| `codexcomp install-service` | Opt-in autostart registration for the current platform. |
| `codexcomp uninstall-service` | Remove the autostart entry. |
| `codexcompw` | Windowless entry (Windows); logs to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\codexcomp\codexcompw.log`. |

| Flag | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--host` | `127.0.0.1` | Bind address — keep it loopback. |
| `--port` | `8787` | Must match `openai_base_url`; if busy the proxy exits. |
| `--upstream` | `https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex` | Upstream base URL. |
| `--log-level` | `info` | One of `critical` / `error` / `warning` / `info` / `debug`. |
| `--max-n` | `0` | Highest `518n−2` tier to auto-continue; `0` = no cap (cuts up to n=21 observed). |
| `--max-continue` | `3` | Max continuation rounds per request (runaway guard). |

## Autostart (optional, off by default)

```bash
codexcomp install-service     # register + start (current platform)
codexcomp uninstall-service   # remove
```

- **Linux / WSL** — systemd **user** unit; `loginctl enable-linger` starts it at boot without
  login.
- **macOS** — launchd **LaunchAgent** in `~/Library/LaunchAgents/`.
- **Windows** — prints manual steps only: point a Startup shortcut (`Win+R` → `shell:startup`)
  at the windowless `codexcompw` (`where.exe codexcompw`). Delete it to disable.

With WSL2 `networkingMode=mirrored`, Windows and WSL share `127.0.0.1`: run one proxy in WSL
and just add the `openai_base_url` line on the Windows side — no second proxy needed.

## Verify

```bash
curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:8787/healthz            # {"ok":true,...}
journalctl --user -u codexcomp -f | grep -E 'round|done'   # Linux/WSL
```

The health response also reports the current upstream-client generation and active upstream /
WebSocket counts. If the shared upstream pool becomes exhausted, codexcomp logs a sanitized pool
snapshot, rotates the client once, and lets Codex's next retry use a fresh pool without restarting
the process. A failed proxy handshake is handled the same way when no other upstream stream is
active, preventing dead handshakes from accumulating into later pool starvation. An upstream
read that stalls for 120 s times out through the normal terminal contract instead of pinning
a pool connection for minutes.

A live fold — two consecutive 516s folded, answer correct:

```
round 1: in=21550 out=664 reason=516 total=22214 | n=1 buffered=['function_call'] -> continue
round 2: in=22078 out=652 reason=516 total=22730 | n=1 buffered=['function_call'] -> continue
round 3: in=22606 out=566 reason=291 total=23172 | n=None buffered=[...] -> clean
done: 3 round(s) | ... | status=completed stop=natural
```

Round verdicts: `continue` (cut detected → will continue), `clean` (natural end),
`tier_out_of_window` / `max_continue` / `no_encrypted_content` (cut detected but released
as-is), `compaction_request` (remote-compaction request — never folded),
`upstream_eof` (stream ended without a terminal event). `done:` lines end with
`stop=natural` or the release reason. A fold torn down by a client disconnect logs
`fold aborted downstream after N round(s)` instead of a `done:` line.

## Evals

Two A/B evals ship inside the package and are available right after install.
Both measure the fix end-to-end: a model × effort × proxy-on/off grid of
`codex exec` calls, reporting boundary-cut rate, reasoning tokens and accuracy
per condition:

- `codexcomp-eval` — the candy pigeonhole puzzle from
  [haowang02/codex-candy-eval](https://github.com/haowang02/codex-candy-eval)
  (answer: 21, independently re-verified by brute force); a short trap-style
  question that under-thinking runs get wrong fast.
- `codexcomp-sudoku-eval` — a hard 6×6 arithmetic-cage sudoku with four given
  anchor cells; its chained deduction spends far more reasoning tokens and hits
  the `518n−2` lattice across many rounds — a stress test for fold stability.

Both modes wire `openai_base_url` explicitly, so the ambient config doesn't
matter; results append to `<out>/results.jsonl`, so an interrupted grid resumes
by re-running the same command. Per-round fold detail for `on` runs is read from
the systemd user unit's journal when it is active. Runs are serial by default;
`--parallel N` opts into N concurrent runs — faster, but it disables per-round
journal capture (folded runs are then detected from usage fingerprints only) and
spends tokens faster. The harness wraps `codex exec` in coreutils `timeout`, so
it needs Linux/WSL (macOS needs coreutils).

```bash
codexcomp &                                     # proxy must be running for `on`
codexcomp-eval -m gpt-5.5 -r xhigh -n 5         # small grid
codexcomp-eval                                  # default grid (gpt-5.5 × medium,xhigh × on/off × 4 reps)
codexcomp-sudoku-eval -r xhigh,ultra,max        # long-reasoning stress grid
```

Inside a checkout use `uv run codexcomp-eval` for the same thing.

An 80-run grid of the candy eval (2026-07-06) found every unmitigated gpt-5.5 run
cut exactly on a `518n−2` boundary, 15% vs 90% accuracy off/on — details in
[openai/codex#30364](https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/30364#issuecomment-4893087004).

## FAQ

**Does it touch normal turns?**
No. Clean rounds pass through byte-for-byte; the fold path only engages on a detected
`518n−2` truncation.

**What does a fold cost?**
Continuation rounds spend extra real tokens, bounded by the continuation cap
(`--max-continue`, default 3). The true cumulative usage is reported under
`metadata.proxy_billed_usage`.

**Does it work with the gpt-5.6 series?**
Mechanically yes — the `518n−2` lattice still appears on gpt-5.6 and folding engages exactly
as on gpt-5.5 — but it no longer buys accuracy: in a 192-run A/B grid, proxied and direct
accuracy were identical. A 5.6 run that hits the lattice usually has a complete answer
already, and 5.6's real losses (reasoning collapsing to a few hundred tokens at *non-lattice*
values — under-thinking, not truncation) are invisible to any proxy. If you only use 5.6,
unwire codexcomp (folds just spend extra tokens); it remains fully effective for gpt-5.5.
Grid data in [#11](https://github.com/dzshzx/codexcomp/issues/11).

**What happens when OpenAI fixes this upstream?**
Nothing breaks — the detector simply stops firing and the proxy becomes a transparent
passthrough. Unwire it by deleting the `openai_base_url` line whenever you like.

**Why not a separate `[model_providers]` entry?**
That changes the provider id, which re-buckets session history and drops remote compaction
and remote-control. `openai_base_url` is the official in-place override of the built-in
`openai` provider.

**Is my credential safe?**
The proxy forwards the `Authorization` header untouched and binds to loopback only; it never
reads, persists, or logs a credential.

## Security & disclaimer

- **Auth passthrough only** — forwards Codex's `Authorization` header; never reads, persists,
  or logs a credential.
- **Loopback only** — do not expose it on a non-loopback interface.
- **Unofficial** — it relies on non-contract upstream behavior; an OpenAI-side change may break
  it. Use at your own risk.
- Continuation spends **extra real tokens** (`metadata.proxy_billed_usage`), bounded by the
  `--max-continue` cap (default 3 rounds).

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dzshzx/codexcomp && cd codexcomp
uv sync
uv run python test_fold.py        # fold state-machine self-test → ALL PASS
uv run python test_ws.py          # transport self-test (WS protocol, headers) → ALL PASS
uv run codexcomp                  # run locally
```

Releases go out via PyPI Trusted Publishing (OIDC, no stored token). Put the candidate version
on `master`, wait for CI on that exact commit to pass, then push a matching annotated `v*` tag.
Tags are immutable: a failed tagged candidate is fixed in the next patch, never moved or reused.
The release workflow reruns the shared CI gate and verifies that the tag matches the package
version and points into `master` before publishing. Version history: [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).
